# üåç ETL Pipeline ‚Äî Countries by GDP (Nominal)

## Overview
This project was developed by **Ordi Bimvy**, a Data Engineering student at Thomas College, as part of a practical ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) exercise.  
The goal was to build a complete ETL pipeline that scrapes real-world GDP data, transforms it into a structured format, and loads it into both a CSV file and a database table.

## üß© ETL Breakdown

### 1. Extract
- Source: [Wikipedia ‚Äì List of countries by GDP (nominal)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29)
- Tooling: `requests` + `BeautifulSoup`
- Logic:
  - Parse the webpage HTML.
  - Identify the correct table (`index 2` from `<tbody>` list).
  - Extract rows that contain valid data (non-empty, with hyperlink, and GDP not `'‚Äî'`).
  - Store extracted values into a pandas DataFrame.

### 2. Transform
- Clean GDP text data by removing commas and converting from string ‚Üí float.
- Convert GDP from **USD Millions ‚Üí USD Billions**.
- Round all values to **2 decimal places** using NumPy.
- Rename column `GDP_USD_millions` ‚Üí `GDP_USD_billions`.

### 3. Load
- Save the cleaned dataset to a **CSV file** (`Countries_by_GDP.csv`).
- (Optional) Load the same data into a SQLite database (`World_Economies.db`) for analysis.
